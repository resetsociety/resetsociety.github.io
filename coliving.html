        <p class="home__intro__big_copy">Buying some land or renting a space and use it to build open source construction and agriculture machinery, that we then use to build an aquaponics greenhouse and some utilities and habitable buildings. We can organise workshops, design and build larger buildings, etc.</p>

  <h2>The path</h2>

  <p>Coliving in large rented house with garden in Rincón de la Victoria. Depending on the wishes of the members of the project and on the house itself, we add one or several elements:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A vegetable garden, ideally together with a worm compost and a few chicken;</li>
    <li>An aquaponics system;</li>
    <li>Other small-scale food production items, such as growing mushrooms on a trunk or growing larvae to feed the fish in the aquaponics (thus making it a self-sustainable permaculture production);</li>
    <li>A small hackspace, e.g. to build some devices to make growing food easier;</li>
    <li>A larger hackspace, e.g. to build things such as Precious Plastics plastic recycling machines;</li>
    <li>Energy production devices - we will try to produce as much as our energy as possible, while taking into account the possible limitations due to the infrastructure of the house and its owners.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Several houses could be rented by different groups and specialise in different subjects :)</p>

  <p>Minimum amount of people per house: 4</p>

  <p>Specific skills: if no experience with any of the proposed activities, willingness to get your hands dirty and learn.</p>
  <p>Commitment: low. I.e. normal commitment related to houseshare, helping with at least one of the activities developed in the house.</p>
  <p>Minimum amount of investment (on top of association’s membership fee): €1,500. Further small investments might be required depending on what we develop.</p>

  <p>Note: The members are responsible for renting the house, taking care of it and organising themselves around the regular chores of the house, like they would do when sharing accommodation in normal life.</p>
