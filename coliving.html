    <h2>The path</h2>

    <p>We would like to rent a large and beautiful house with a garden in Rincón de la Victoria, such as as <a href="https://www.idealista.com/alquiler-viviendas/rincon-de-la-victoria-malaga/con-chalets,casas-de-pueblo,de-cuatro-cinco-habitaciones-o-mas,exterior/" target="_blank">one of those</a> and share it with a few people. We think that it’s a great way to work together and to start implementing solutions that enable us to reduce our environmental footprint in a economical way while improving our quality of life.
  There are many things that we could do there:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A vegetable garden, ideally together with a worm compost and a few chicken;</li>
      <li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics" target="_blank">aquaponics</a> system;</li>
      <li>Other small-scale food production items, such as growing mushrooms on a trunk, or growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetia_illucens" target="_blank"> black soldier flies</a> to feed the fish in the aquaponics, thus making it a self-sustainable permaculture production;</li>
      <li>A small hackspace, e.g. to build some devices to make growing food easier;</li>
      <li>A larger hackspace, e.g. to build things such as <a herf="https://preciousplastic.com/en/" target="_blank"> Precious Plastics </a> plastic recycling machines;</li>
      <li>Energy production devices - we will try to produce as much as our energy as possible, while taking into account the possible limitations due to the infrastructure of the house and its owners;</li>
      <li>And would like to have a goat too, because we really like them, but that might not be realistic :)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We are really looking forward to producing some of our food, having fresh eggs every week, generating our energy and having a place dedicated to hacking and building stuff. Because it’s fun, and because it will make us proud of being able to produce some of the things that we need to sustain ourselves. We could also use this to organise hackathons, small workshops to teach how to set up aquaponics, how to build arduinos, and many more things...</p>
    <p>Of course several houses could be rented by different groups and specialise in different subjects :)</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <div class="article__requirements">
      <p><strong>Specific skills:</strong> if no experience with any of the proposed activities, willingness to get your hands dirty and learn.</p>
      <p><strong>Commitment:</strong> low. I.e. normal commitment related to houseshare, helping with at least one of the activities developed in the house.</p>
      <br><br>
      <div class="article__requirements__with_details">
        <p><strong>Minimum amount of investment*:</strong> €1,500.</p>
        <p class="article__requirements__details">* Required for: aquaponics (pieces of the system, maintenance equipment, substrate, fish and seeds); chicken (coop and wire fence, small equipments, chicken); tools (for building the coop and the aquaponics and to put in the workshop aka hackspace), safety equipment.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Further small investments might be required depending on what we develop, and it is likely that there will be a member's fee.</p>
    <p>Note: the members are responsible for renting the house, taking care of it and organising themselves around the regular chores of the house, like they would do when sharing accommodation in normal life.</p>
