  <h2>Who we are</h2>

  <h3>Aurélie Gwez</h3>
  <p>Sit in box asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) so pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms, or inspect anything brought into the house flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. The dog smells bad go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. Meow then cats take over the world always hungry sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor yet lick the curtain just to be annoying howl on top of tall thing. Hack up furballs favor packaging over toy yet paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away and lies down wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again so sleep nap human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite.</p>

  <h3>Rafa you choose how many names you put here</h3>
  <p>Cats secretly make all the worlds muffins eat all the power cords but purr for no reason or thug cat chase dog then run away for why must they do that, so meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing. Favor packaging over toy sleep on keyboard. If it smells like fish eat as much as you wish meow to be let in yet drink water out of the faucet for the dog smells bad and climb leg lick the other cats meow to be let out. Chirp at birds kitty loves pigs. Step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle throwup on your pillow brown cats with pink ears. Dream about hunting birds refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass for curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels, and claws in your leg jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed claws in your leg yet meoooow!.</p>

    <h2>What we want to do</h2>

    <h3>Develop a model that is easy to replicate</h3>
<p>We have a non-ambitious goal: we want to change the world. We want to do that by developing a model that is accessible. There are some projects out there featuring the building of a whole new district or even town, and we are pretty excited about those, but we want to make ours easier to reproduce. We are thus starting small and we expect to grow little by little. We are also trying to make it quite simple, so that it doesn’t require too often levels of expertise that can be difficult to have access to.</p>
<p>The model needs to be economically sustainable, i.e. not to rely on external financial help in the long run.</p>
<p>The model needs to be open to participants who can only offer limited resources, whether these are money, time or anything else. We cannot change the world if only privileged people can afford the change.</p>
<p>The model will rely as much as possible on tools, devices and techniques that are available in open-source, because that is key to replicability and improvement.</p>
<p>We will make the techniques, devices, etc that we develop available in open-source.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Reduce our environmental footprint to the minimum</h3>
<p>While maintaining a high quality of life, which is mostly based on our surroundings, on quality food, on reduced commute, on being part of a network of people…</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t make sense to damage our habitat, nor to release harmful products in our food, our water or our air.</p>
<p>Because it makes sense to to promote and implement regenerative systems that are efficient in the short and long term rather than systems that require more additives and are not efficient in the long run.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Be sustainable form a human point of view</h3>
<p>With a good quality of life: pleasant surroundings, quality food, reduced commute, no need for private vehicle, easy access to outdoors leisure, reduced working times, cooperation-based community…</p>
<p>With a system that does not request unreasonable efforts from people and is open to different ways of being involved.</p>
<p>With a community that promotes collaborative decision making and where voices are heard.</p>
<p>With a model aiming towards social equity, i.e. giving the same opportunities to all and, though there might be an imbalance in who can receive those benefits (i.e., social or economical conditions), it is there for equitable distribution.</p>

  <h2>What we don't want to do</h2>
  <h3>Build the typical hippie village or community</h3>
  <p>Although we have several things in common with hippie villages or community, since our project was inspired by those. This is however not what we want to build, because they are already many of them; because we want a to live somewhere accessible, i.e. that doesn’t require a private vehicle nor spending >1h in a bus to go to a city or a transport hub.</p>
  <p>They also often are synonym of rejecting modern technology, whereas we love modern technology and are convinced that if well used, it can bring the solutions we need to reduce our environmental footprint as well as social injustice.</p>
  <p>Besides, they only target people who are already convinced. We want to convince people who are not.</p>

  <h3>Become isolated from the rest of the world</h3>
  <p>We want our model to be accessible and practical, it thus needs to be connected with the rest of the world.</p>
  <p>We want to demonstrate to other potential participants that a better system is possible, and for that we need to be connected.
  There are a lot of things that we like in the rest of the world :)</p>

  <h3>Preach to the choir and only that</h3>
  Preaching to the choir, aka convincing people who already share our ideas, is easy, and will happen even if we don’t try to do it. We want to design a better system and prove to those who do not believe in alternate solutions that those are viable. We basically just want to change the world.

  <h3>Be dogmatic</h3>
  <p>We want to be as unbiased as possible. We want to be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong">scouts, not soldiers</a>. We want to follow scientific principles.</p>

  <h3>Have permanent allies and enemies</h3>
  <p>People, companies, governments, etc, change their mind or practices. It’s not because someone did something that goes against our principles once or even most of the time that they are enemies and that we cannot cooperate. They might go in a different direction at some point, that doesn’t mean that we consider them as enemies. The same goes with allies.</p>
  <p>We don’t want to automatically accept or reject people or structures due to their nature or orientation. E.g. even though we are more oriented towards non-profit structures, we might welcome cooperation with for-profit entities when it make sense or reject cooperation with a non-profit structure when we think that they are not going in the right direction.</p>

  <h3>Have every member to be happy about every single decision taken</h3>
  <p>Because that’s just impossible. We will always have disagreements, and that’s fine.</p>
  <p>We want members to understand and apply a principle of consensus decision-making: that a decision doesn’t imply the active consentment of every person, but rather their acceptance in the sense of absence of rejection. In practice, that means if one doesn’t agree with a proposal but doesn’t have a really strong reason to go against it (a strong reason could be that they consider that the proposal implies an unacceptable risk), the person will not vote against the proposal. In short, that means not blocking decisions that we don’t fully embrace but can live with.</p>
  <p>Besides, a number of decisions are taken by the person or group in charge of the issue, who usually has the relevant knowledge and skills. E.g. decisions regarding user experience (UX) on our website are made by the UX specialist(s) and the content of a press release is determined by a communications person. While general trends might be discussed within a larger group, the tactics and technicalities are left to the one(s) in charge. </p>

  <h3>Solve all issues at once</h3>
  <p>Because that’s impossible. We know that we won’t solve everything that we want to solve in short term, nor in the middle term, and probably not even in the long term. We don’t have the resources to do so, and we are realistic.</p>
  <p>That also means that if our project -or a part of it- doesn’t solve X problem doesn’t imply that we don’t want to solve it. It just implies that at this point of the development of our project we don’t have the means to solve it.</p>
