  <h2>The path</h2>

  <p>We have been following the work of <a href="opensourceecology.org" target="_blank">Open Source Ecology</a> for a while and we really, really like it. So we want to move to the next step and actually implement it. We see it as an awesome way to empower the local community and economy. It can enable people who wouldn’t be afford to buy or rent such tools to buy, rent or make them. It’s an opportunity to create jobs and cooperatives and companies. We could make bricks that have a ridiculously small environmental impact in comparison with the common ones, and that can be used for very solid and well insulated buildings. And those buildings could be designed and even made by the people who will live in those, which makes the whole thing much cheaper, more adapted to one’s needs, and also a source of pride.</p>
  <p>How do we do that? Here as the steps that we are thinking of taking, not necessarily in that order:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Buying some land (as a cooperative) in the village or its outskirts;</li>
    <li>Building Open Source Ecology (OSE) machinery for agriculture and construction;</li>
    <li>Building structures based on the work of OSE: <a href="http://openbuildinginstitute.org/portfolio/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop-1/" target="_blank">aquaponics greenhouse</a>, small living units;</li>
    <li>Growing food following permaculture principles, with a vegetable garden, some chicken,chicken, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetia_illucens" target="_blank">black soldier fly</a> production, aquaponics, mushrooms;</li>
    <li>Producing as much as possible of our energy;</li>
    <li>Organising workshops on how to do all of the above;</li>
    <li>Optional: designing and building more things, such as multiple floor apartment buildings (that depends on our funds, on legal matters, on what members want to do, etc);</li>
    <li>Optional: sell Compressed Earth Bricks, sell fair construction services...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We can also start with renting some adequate space (warehouse, garage) to use it as a workshop and assemble the machines before buying some land and starting building there.</p>

  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <div class="article__requirements">
    <p><strong>Specific skills:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to use tools and build relatively complex machines (at least 1 person).</li>
    <li>Ability to build and program devices based on Arduino (at least 1 person).</li>
    <li>Ability to deal with heavy machinery (at least 1 person).</li>
    <li>Ideally: engineering skills.</li>
    <li>Ideally: architect.</li>
    <li>Ideally: legal counsel.</li>
  </ul>


    <p><strong>Minimum amount of people:</strong> 4, among which several people with enough time to dedicate at least 1 full-time equivalent (FTE).</p>
    <p><strong>Commitment level:</strong> low to high. From helping a bit here and there to dedicating full time on it and making a living out of the outcome.</p>
    <div class="article__requirements__with_details">
      <p><strong>Minimum amount of investment*:</strong> at least €60,000 to start.</p>
      <p class="article__requirements__details">*Required for: land, raw materials for the machines, tools, safety equipment, administrative and legal matters, possible costs for professional help for building the machines and/or using specific tools (e.g. laser cutter), energy. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

   <p> Further rounds of investments of several thousands will be required as the project goes on depending on what we decide to build. The initial investment might change should the market change.</p>
  <p>Note: We know that we are unlikely to be allowed to do all of the above easily. What we are allowed to do on a plot of land depends on its type and subtype, thus what we will be allowed to do depends on what type of land is available for sale when we decide to start this path.</p>

          <p>During this phase of the project we are looking for people that can participate in our coworking for themselves and have the hability to create more openings and resources over time. Senior and medior developers and designers usually fit this profile best.</p>
          <p>If you are able to produce resources in any other way or you are an excellent Quality of Life provider, feel free to send us an open application. But please bear in mind we are very few people in this early stage :)</p>-->
          <h4>We want to hear from you</h4>
          <p>
            Do you want to participate in our project, suggest an idea? Do you have questions? Or you are in the region and want to meet? You can get in touch with us through our social media accounts - see on the right side - or by dropping us an email. We’re looking forward to hearing from you!
