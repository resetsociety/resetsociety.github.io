        <p class="home__intro__big_copy">With phases that we will roll out one after another. They are kind of layers: a new phase will not replace the previous one but will complete it. Each phase requires some investment in terms of time and money, we will thus need a bit of time before implementing the next one. If you think you can help us go faster because you have time/money/adequate skills/are running a similar project, you are more than welcome to contact us!</p>

  <h2>Phase 0</h2>
<p>We (the founders of the project) researched where would be a pleasant place to live and settled in Rincón de la Victoria. There we have been exploring the area and are preparing the further phases of the project. </p>
<p><strong>Right now, we are looking for people who want to join us for the next phase: a coworking space</strong> in this lovely coastal town. If you want to come to this beautiful place, we can help you to settle, just <a href="mailto:admin@resetsociety.com?Subject=Hello%20resetsociety">get in touch</a> with us! </p>

  <h2>Phase 1</h2>
  <p>We create a coworking space with an international group of like-minded people who want to live and work in a place with an excellent quality of life, subtropical weather and very well communicated, Rincón de la Victoria. We expect some of these people to be interested in our project and to be willing invest in it so that we can move faster to the further phases. Investing might sound like a big word, but it doesn’t have to be: spending a few more euros every month is already helpful, and will make you a proud collaborator of our initiative, along with other perks.</p>


<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>We rent a plot of land and produce food applying permaculture principles. It could look <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop/">like this</a>, although we will probably start with something a bit smaller. We can thus produce our own food in a very efficient and very environmentally friendly way and experiment with different designs. Collaborators of the project own some of the food produced there.
</p>

<h2>Phase 3</h2>
<p>We have several ideas in mind here. Which one we implement will depend on our collaborators - that can be you - and the resources available. We can also implement one option and then the other.</p>

<p>Option a: we open a small restaurant where we serve the food we produced. That way, we can promote local environmentally friendly food production and generate some revenues. We can also organise workshop on small scale agriculture and permaculture.</p>

<p>Option b: we acquire a middle-sized building (e.g. one of the large abandoned houses in the village, with swimming pool or land, which we could renovate), which we can use for many things: a coworking space, a coliving space, a venue for workshops and talks, a leisure area for our collaborators, a playground for testing new technologies in the field of renewable energy or at home recycling, etc.</p>


<h2>Phase 4</h2>
<p>To be continued…</p>

          <p>During this phase of the project we are looking for people that can participate in our coworking for themselves and have the hability to create more openings and resources over time. Senior and medior developers and designers usually fit this profile best.</p>
          <p>If you are able to produce resources in any other way or you are an excellent Quality of Life provider, feel free to send us an open application. But please bear in mind we are very few people in this early stage :)</p>
