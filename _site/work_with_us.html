  <h2>What are we looking for?</h2>

  <p>For the first step of <a href="/our_plan.html">our plan</a> we want to gather people willing to change things. We are in Rincon de la Victoria, a place with an excellent quality of life, subtropical weather and very well communicated. </p>

  <p>We are looking for people who would like to live in such place and to engage in projects that further improve this quality of life -while preventing gentrification- and that increase sustainability. People can participate in three different ways: <a href="#solo">on their own</a>, as <a href="#companies">companies</a> or apply to the <a href="#open-positions">open positions</a> the existing companies already offer there. </p>

  <h2 id="solo">Change the world while working in what you love</h2>
  <p>If you can work remotely, you can come and work with us. Just keep doing that thing you love and do so nicely for living but from a better place.</p>
  <p>Right now we are looking mainly for developers, designers and usability experts so we can create synergies, and organize events around development or even create projects around the goals of Reset Society. In any case as long as you are able to sustain yourself working remotely you will be more than welcome to join us.</p>
  <p>If you are planning to grow or just looking for new colleagues this is also a great place to start networking and looking for candidates.</p>

  <h2 id="companies">Change the world with your company</h2>
  <p>If you belong to a company that really cares about their workers, or even better, if you belong to a company involved in social entrepreneurship and is building something to improve the world, that is great! Come and let's join forces! </p>
  <p>You can join us to create a great coworking space and take advantage of all the networking that will come and the improvements we can create together.</p>

  <h2 id="open-positions">Or apply to our companies</h2>
  <p>As individuals and companies join and grow they will be needing more people. For now we have the following open positions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://betabeers.com/post/frontend-developer-ux-developer-at-tolqcom-30-45000eur-2394/">Frontend Developer / UX Developer at Tolq.com [30 - 45.000â‚¬]</a></li>
  </ul>

          <p>During this phase of the project we are looking for people that can participate in our coworking for themselves and have the hability to create more openings and resources over time. Senior and medior developers and designers usually fit this profile best.</p>
          <p>If you are able to produce resources in any other way or you are an excellent Quality of Life provider, feel free to send us an open application. But please bear in mind we are very few people in this early stage :)</p>
