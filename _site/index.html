        <p>Reset Society is an initiative to build an economically viable, environmentally sound and socially responsible community in a small town. A place where city folks can escape the hassle and problems that blight major urban areas but still enjoy rich social interaction and keep progressing in their careers. </p>

  <h2 class="home__heading">The principles</h2>
  <p class="home__section_intro">Reset society is based on three principles, ordered by priority: People's wellbeing, Sustainability and Replicability</p>

  <ul class="home__what">
    <li class="home__what__item">
      <div class="home__what__caption"><img src="img/ethics.png" alt="People's well-being"></div>
      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>People's wellbeing</h3>
        <p>We aim to relieve them from as many sources of worry as possible and invest the majority of profits in further developing those life improvements.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="home__what__item">
      <div class="home__what__caption"><img src="img/sustainable.png" alt="Sustainability"></div>
      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <p>We want to have the smallest possible footprint by being self-sufficient when possible and supporting technological innovation while providing a good quality of life and maintaining an economically viable model.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="home__what__item">
      <div class="home__what__caption"><img src="img/growth.png" alt="Reaching as much people as possible"></div>
      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Replicability</h3>
        <p>We therefore aim to reach as many people as possible by expanding our community as well as creating a replicable model that can be applied in other communities.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="container container--bigger container--padded">
  <h2 class="home__heading">How?</h2>
  <p class="home__section_intro">In order to progress <a href="">and manage to fulfill The Plan</a>  we will need two different kinds of people collaborating.</p>

  <ul class="home__how">
    <li class="home__how__item home__how__qot_image"><img src="img/smile.png" alt="prueba"></li>
    <li class="home__how__item home__how__qot_copy">
      <h3>Quality of life providers</h3>
      <p>Quality of life providers are people who help to improve everyone’s life but don't specifically provide resources: cooks, accountants, doctors... Without them, relieving members of their everyday burdens would be impossible.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="home__how__item home__how__resources_image"><img src="img/money.png" alt="prueba"></li>
    <li class="home__how__item home__how__resources_copy">
      <h3>Resource providers</h3>
      <p>Resource providers will first be producing money to sustain the rest of the community. Once the community is stable enough, anyone with the ability to provide resources such as energy, food or shelter will also be a resource provider. Other resource providers could include IT experts working remotely, farmers, etc. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <p class="home__where__copy">More specifically: in a quiet and lovely district of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinc%C3%B3n_de_la_Victoria" target="_blank">Rincón de la Victoria</a>, a small coastal town close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1laga" target="_blank">Malaga</a>, on the Costa del Sol. There we can enjoy at the same time the luxury of a peaceful environment with the beach just a few meters away as well as the liveliness of Malaga and its international community. Malaga is also connected by highspeed trains and direct flights to many European cities, making it easy to travel to and from Spain and Europe. </p>

  <div class="home__why">
    <h2>Why resetsociety?</h2>
    <p>Humanity gets more efficient every year at doing the things that keep us alive and give us wellbeing. But instead of improving our lives, working less and taking better care of our resources and environment we do the opposite. This project is just a humble attempt to demonstrate that society can work for itself.</p>

          <p>If you are able to produce resources in any other way or you are an excellent Quality of Life provider, feel free to send us an open application. But please bear in mind we are very few people in this early stage :)</p>
