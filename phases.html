        <h1 class="home__intro__tagline">How do we implement our project?</h1>
        <p class="home__intro__big_copy">We thought of having some phases that we will roll out one after another. They are kind of layers: a new phase will not replace the previous one but will complete it. Each phase requires some investment in terms of time and money, we will thus need a bit of time before implementing the next one. But if you think you can help us go faster because you have time/money/adequate skills/are running a similar project you are more than welcome to contact us!</p>

  <h2>Phase 0</h2>
<p>We (the founders of the project) researched where would be a pleasant place to live and settled in Rincón de la Victoria. There we have been exploring the area and its resources and are preparing the further phases of the project. Right now, we are looking for people who want to join us for the next phase, a co-working space in this coastal town. If you want to come to the beautiful place, we can help you to settle, just <a href="mailto:admin@resetsociety.com?Subject=Hello%20resetsociety">get in touch with us</a>! </p>

  <h2>Phase 1</h2>
  <p>We create a co-working space with an international group of like-minded people who want to live and work in a place with an excellent quality of life, subtropical weather and very well communicated, Rincón de la Victoria. We expect that some these people to be interested in our project and will invest in it so that we can move faster to the further phases. Investing might sound like a big word, but it doesn’t have to be - spending a few more euros every month is already helpful, and will make you a proud collaborator of our initiative, along with other perks.</p>
    

<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>We rent a plot of land close-by and produce food following permaculture principles. It could look <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop/">like this</a>, although we will probably start with something a bit smaller. We are quite excited about experimenting with a way to produce food that is extremely efficient, very environmentally friendly and that mixes traditional practices with modern technology. Collaborators of the project will own some of the food produced there.
</p>

<h2>Phase 3</h2>
<p>We have several ideas in mind here. Which one we will implement will depend on our collaborators - that can be you - and the resources available. We can also implement one option and then the other.</p>

<p>Option a. We open a small restaurant where we serve the food we produced. That way, we can promote local environmentally friendly food production, permaculture methods and generate some revenues. We can also organise workshop on small scale agriculture and permaculture.</p>

<p>Option b. We acquire a middle-sized building (e.g. one of the large abandoned houses in the village, with swimming pool or land, which we could renovate), which we can use for many things: a co-working space, a co-living space, a venue for workshops and talks, a leisure area for our collaborators, a playground for testing new technologies in the field of renewable energy…</p>


<h2>Phase 4</h2>
<p>To be continued...</p>
