  <p>Here are the phases through which we want to develop our project. They are kind of layers: a new phase will not replace the previous one but will complete it. Each phase requires some investment in terms of time and money, we will thus need a bit of time before implementing the next one. But if you think you can help us go faster because you have time/money/adequate skills/are running a similar project/ you are more than welcome to contact us!</p>
  
  <p>Phase 0
We (the founders of the project) researched where would be a pleasant place to live and settled in Rincón de la Victoria. There we have been exploring the area and its ressources and are preparing the further phases of the project.
phase 0.5 (right now)
We are looking for people who want to join us for the next phase, a co-working space in Rincón de la Victoria. If you want to come to the beautiful place, we can help you to settle, just get in touch with us! </p>

  <p>Phase 1
    The first phase of <a href="/our_plan.html">our plan</a> is extremely simple: create a co-working space with an international group of like-minded people who want to live and work in a place with an excellent quality of life, subtropical weather and very well communicated, Rincón de la Victoria. We expect that some these people to be interested in our project and will invest in it so that we can move faster to the further phases. Investing might sound like a big word, but it doesn’t have to be - spending a few more euros every month is already helpful, and will make you a proud collaborator of our initiative, along with other perks.</p>

  <p>We are looking for people who would like to live in such place and to engage in projects that further improve that quality of life and improve sustainability. People can participate in three different ways: <a href="#solo">on their own</a>, as <a href="#companies">companies</a> or apply to the <a href="#open-positions">open positions</a> the existing companies already offer there. </p>

<p>Phase 2
We rent a plot of land close-by and produce food following permaculture principles. It could look <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/aquaponic-greenhouse-workshop/">like this</a>, although we will probably start with something a it smaller. We are quite excited about experimenting with a way to produce food that is extremely efficient, very environmentally friendly, that mixes traditional practices with modern technology, and that well, enables us to produce our own food. Collaborators of the project own some of the food produced there.
</p>

<p>Phase 3
We have several ideas in mind here. Which one we will implement will depend on our collaborators - that can be you - and the ressources available. We can also employment one option, and then the other.

option a. We open a small restaurant where we serve the food we produced. That way, we can promote local environmentally friendly food production, permaculture methods and generate some revenues. We can also organise workshop on small scale agriculture and permaculture.

option b. We acquire a middle-sized building (e.g. one of the large abandoned houses in the village, with swimming pool or land, which we could rehabilitate; an unused school or medical center…), which we can use for many things: a co-working space, a co-living space, a venue for workshops and talks, a leisure area for our collaborators, a playground for testing new technologies in the field of renewable energy…</p>


<p>Phase 4
to be continued...</p>
