  <h2>What are we looking for?</h2>

  <p>For the first step of <a href="/the_plan.html">our plan</a> we want to gather people willing to change things. We are in Rincón de la Victoria, a place with an excellent quality of life, subtropical weather and which is very well communicated. </p>

  <p>We are looking for people who would like to live in such place and to engage in projects that further improve this quality of life -while preventing gentrification- and that increase sustainability. People can participate in different ways, <a href="#solo">on their own</a> or as <a href="#companies">companies</a>. </p>

  <h2 id="solo">Change the world while working in what you love</h2>
  <p>If you can work remotely, you can come and work with us. Just keep doing that thing you love and do so nicely for living but from a better place.</p>
  <p>Right now we are looking mainly for developers, designers and usability experts so we can create synergies, and organize events around development or even create projects around the goals of Reset Society. In any case as long as you are able to sustain yourself working remotely you will be more than welcome to join us.</p>

  <h2 id="companies">Change the world with your company</h2>
  <p>If you belong to a company that really cares about their workers, or even better, if you belong to a company involved in social entrepreneurship and is building something to improve the world, that is great! Come and let's join forces! </p>
  <p>If you are condidering getting involved in a coworking space we'd be glad to help; we have done some market reasearch and thus have useful information and contacts.</p>

  <h2>What do we offer now?</h2>
  <p>If you are considering joining us, here is what we offer to you making a decision and then settling:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Free stay at our place* (about a week) so that you can test whether you like it here and so that we get to know each other and see if we can work together. This is a vital step If you are thinking of joining us and do not live here.</li>
    <li>Free stay at our place* (about a couple of weeks) while you are looking for a place or waiting for it to be available.</li>
    <li>Help to find a place to live so that it’s much easier for you, and so that you avoid the outsider price.</li>
    <li>Help settling in and getting your ducks in a row - info on where the shops, the best places to eat or the bus stop are, what administrative processes you need to follow and other tips regarding many matters…</li>
    <li>Someone to have a drink with - yes, we know where to find the local artisanal beer as well as the only homemade sugarfree lemonade of Malaga.</li>
    <li>Once we have the requested amount of people along with the right skills (if applicable) and investment for one of the paths, we will launch that path. Note that if we are already running one, we might not be ready to launch another one immediately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>*We offer a bedroom in our house close to the centre of the town. Other costs are at your own expense.</p>
