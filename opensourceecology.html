  <h2>The steps</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Buying some land (as a cooperative) in the village or its outskirts;</li>
    <li>Building Open Source Ecology machinery for agriculture and construction;</li>
    <li>Building structures based on the work of OBI: aquaponic greenhouse, small living units, small utility units;</li>
    <li>Growing food following permaculture principles (vegetable garden, aquaponics greenhouse, chicken, fly production, mushrooms, etc);</li>
    <li>Producing as much as possible of our energy;</li>
    <li>Organising workshops on how to do all of the above;</li>
    <li>Optional: designing and building more things, such as multiple floor apartment buildings (that depends on our funds, on legal matters, on what members want to do, etc);</li>
    <li>Pptional: selling fair construction services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Minimum amount of people: 6, among which several people with enough time to dedicate at least 2 full-time equivalent (FTE).</p>

  <h2>Skills required:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to use tools and build relatively complex machines (min 1 FTE),</li>
    <li>Ability to deal with heavy machinery (min 0.5 TBD),</li>
    <li>Ideally: engineering skills</li>
    <li>Ideally: architect</li>
    <li>Ideally: legal counsel</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Commitment level: low (helping a bit here and there) to high (in total at least 2 FTE with specific skills required for several people for the project to be valid; long term investments required).</p>
  <p>Minimum amount of investment (as part as a cooperative): at least â‚¬50,000 to start, more rounds of investments of several thousands will be required as the project goes on depending on what we decide to build. The initial investment might change should the market change.</p>
  <p>Note: We know that we are unlikely to be allowed to do all of the above easily. What we are allowed to do on a plot of land depends on its type and subtype, thus what we will be allowed to do depends on what type of land is available for sale when we decide to start this path.</p>
