  <h2 class="home__heading">The principles</h2>
  <p class="home__section_intro">Reset society is based on three principles, ordered by priority: People's wellbeing, Sustainability and Replicability</p>

      <div class="home__what__caption"><img src="img/ethics.png" alt="People's well-being"></div>
      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>People's wellbeing</h3>
        <p>We aim to relieve them from as many sources of worry as possible and invest the majority of profits in further developing those life improvements.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="home__what__item">
      <div class="home__what__caption"><img src="img/sustainable.png" alt="Sustainability"></div>
      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <p>We want to have the smallest possible footprint by being self-sufficient when possible and supporting technological innovation while providing a good quality of life and maintaining an economically viable model.</p>

      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Replicability</h3>
        <p>We therefore aim to reach as many people as possible by expanding our community as well as creating a replicable model that can be applied in other communities.</p>

  <h2 class="home__heading">How?</h2>

  <p class="home__section_intro">How do we move to the next phase? Well, that depends on you. We have a few sub-projects -let’s call them paths- in mind, which you can see below. We have established a few pre-requisites for each one. Once we have met those, we will start implementing the path.</p>

  <ul class="home__what">

      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Co-living</h3>
        <p>We rent a large house with a garden and we use some of the available space to develop several activities: vegetable garden, chicken coop, aquaponics, energy production, hackspace...</p>

      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Open Source Ecology</h3>
        <p>Buying some land or renting a space and use it to build open source construction and agriculture machinery, that we then use to build an aquaponics greenhouse and some utilities and habitable buildings. We can organise workshops, design and build larger buildings, etc.</p>

      <div class="home__what__item__copy">
        <h3>Your path</h3>
        <p>We have a few other ideas that we would like to give life to, such as sustainable ocean farming or an accelerator for open sources businesses, which need to be more refined so that we consider them as possible next step. If you have a proposal for a new path, we would very much like to hear it from you!</p>

There we can enjoy at the same time the luxury of a peaceful environment with the beach just a few meters away as well as the liveliness of Malaga and its international community. Malaga is also connected by highspeed trains and direct flights to many European cities, making it easy to travel to and from Spain and Europe. </p>

  <div class="home__why">
    <h2>Why resetsociety?</h2>
    <p>Humanity gets more efficient every year at doing the things that keep us alive and give us wellbeing. But instead of improving our lives, working less and taking better care of our resources and environment we do the opposite. This project is just a humble attempt to demonstrate that society can work for itself.</p>
